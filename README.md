I’m @HarlesInCharge 
I consider myself an  artist, creator and mind expander. 


Go with love and embrace the chaos. 

Unpredictable as to appear random,
 owing to great sensitivity to small changes in conditions.
Enjoying processes,
 efficiency and organization. 

I like to play and create music -  
 Blue light frequencies,
for the  
 Worshippers of the Weird.
